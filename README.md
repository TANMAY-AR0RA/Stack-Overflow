# Stack-Overflow

Designed the attack program (exploit.c) to obtain a shell by exploiting stack overflow vulnerability of a given target application (target.c). 
In reality, if this target application is running on a server accepting remote user input, we can use
this exploit code to obtain a command shell (most likely to have root privilege) on the remote server without any password.
